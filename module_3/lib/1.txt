1. Explain the difference between Stateless and Stateful widgets with examples.
-> stateless widgets are static and don't change, while stateful widgets are dynamic and can change in response to user interactions or data changes.
->Examples: Text, icons, and raised buttons.
->Widgets that can change in response to user interactions or data changes.
->Examples: Checkboxes, radio buttons, sliders, and text fields.

2. Describe the widget lifecycle and how state is managed in Stateful widgets.
->A stateful widget in Flutter is a component that can maintain state and update its appearance in response to changes.

3. List and describe five common Flutter layout widgets (e.g., Container, Column, Row).

->Container:
  A versatile widget that acts as a wrapper for other widgets, allowing you to add styling elements like padding, margin, background color, border, and more to a single child widget.

->Column:
  Arranges child widgets vertically, stacking them one on top of the other in a linear fashion.

->Row:
Arranges child widgets horizontally, placing them side-by-side in a line.

->Stack:
  Enables overlapping of child widgets, allowing you to position elements on top of each other.

->Expanded:
  When used within a Row or Column, it allows child widgets to dynamically fill the available space proportionally.
