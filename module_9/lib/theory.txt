1. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit animations in Flutter.
-> Implicit animations automatically animate when their properties change. You don’t need to manage the animation’s progress manually.

2. Describe the purpose of AnimationController and its usage.
-> AnimationController is a powerful class in Flutter used for explicit animations. It controls the animation's duration, speed, direction, and lifecycle (start, stop, repeat, reverse, etc.).

3. Explain the concept of Hero animations in Flutter.
-> A Hero animation in Flutter creates a smooth transition effect between two screens when a shared element (like an image or button) moves from one screen to another.
